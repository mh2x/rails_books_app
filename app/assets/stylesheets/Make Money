Make Money
==========

1. Sell something
   Alibaba, eBay, Amazon FBA, eTsy...
    
    [] Drop-shipping:  
   	   The term, 'Drop-shipping' simply refers to a specific relationship you have with a supplier.  The benefit of this relationship is that you never have to stock any product, or pre-purchase it and risk not selling it.  You sell a product for $100, the supplier charges you $13, and the supplier ships the product straight to the customer for you.
	
	[] Affiliate Marketing: I promote other people's products and services for a commission.  On the internet, this is usually called affiliate marketing.  This is my go-to; I only use the other two where it makes sense.
	
	[] Informational Products: I create informational products and sell them at 100% profit.  eBooks, Guides, Video tutorials, courses, you name it.  You can create your own using your own research, or experience/expertise.  Or, you can find someone else and pay them to make it for you.  You can even combine this with strategy 1 by finding your own army of affiliates to market your product for you.  Just give them half the selling price per sale.
